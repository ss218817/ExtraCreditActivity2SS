    Think about a topic or place, and identify something interesting or significant about it.
     Spin that observation into the form of a question, such as <em>"Why do these particular trees show signs of stress?” 
     or "How do the types of businesses change as we move along this street?” 
     or "What does it matter if that whole area is cleared of trees?"</em><br />
